  - Mmm...I'm feeling a little hungry.
  - Oh! A visitor! Hi! I've never seen a dragon before. You're really small.
  - Ugh, so hungry...
  - See you around!
  - Oh, actually...I've been standing here for the past three hours.
  - I haven't eaten anything in a while, and now it's kinda biting me in the back.
  - Haha! Bite.
  - Okay, thanks! Bye!
  - Um...If you could, can you get me a Bugbun?
  - It's pretty easy to find around here! It's like bread, but with bugs.
  - Eh, it's no problem. See you around!
  - Oh, thank you so much! I'll be right here. 'Cuz I can't go anywhere.
  - Mmm, Bugbun...
  - Ah! You got one! I can really have this?
  - Thank you! Here, I'll pay you back with this!
